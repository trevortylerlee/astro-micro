## Headings

To create headings, use hash symbols (#) followed by a space. The number of hash symbols indicates the heading level.

<Callout>
  Use `h2` tags instead of `h1` tags in the post. Too many `h1` tags on a single
  page can impact SEO. The post title serves as the `h1`.
</Callout>

```md
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6
```

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

---

## Paragraphs

## Ordered Lists

   1. Sub item 1
   2. Sub item 2
3. Item 3
```

3. Item 3

---

## Unordered List

To create an unordered list, add a hyphen \(\-\), an asterisk \(\*\), or a plus sign \(\+\) in front of line items. Don't mix. Use an indent to create a nested list.

```md
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub item 1
  - Sub item 2
- Item 3
```

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Sub item 1

## Images

To add an image, add an exclamation mark (!), followed by alt text in brackets ([]), and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses.

```md
![altText](pathToImage)
```

### Relative

Use the `![altText](./image.*)` pattern relative to the same folder as the markdown file. Notice the period.

```md

>
> with thunderous applause.
```

> So this is how liberty dies...
>
> with thunderous applause.

## Strikethrough

Use a tilde \(\~\) symbol to strikethrough text.

```md
~I don't like sand.~ It's coarse and rough and irritating.
```

E=mc<sup>2</sup>
```

## Task Lists

- [ ] Pass the Jedi Trials
- [ ] Train a padawan
```

## Tables

Use three or more hyphens (-) for the column headers and use pipes (|) to separate each column. You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (:) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens.

```md
| Item   | Count |
| :----- | ----: |
| X-Wing |     1 |
| Y-Wing |     2 |
| A-Wing |     3 |
```

| Item   | Count |
| :----- | ----: |
| X-Wing |     1 |
| Y-Wing |     2 |
| A-Wing |     3 |

---

## Footnotes

Add a caret (^) and an identifier inside brackets \(\[\^1\]\). Identifiers can be numbers or words but can't contain spaces or tabs.

```md
Here's a footnote, [^1] and here's another one. [^2]
[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^2]: This is the second footnote.
```

Here's a footnote, [^1] and here's another one. [^2]
[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^2]: This is the second footnote.

See the bottom of this page to view the footnotes.

---

## Code

To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

```md
`package.json`
```

`package.json`

---

## Code Blocks

Denote a code block by wrapping a section of valid code in triple backticks (`). To enable syntax highlighting, type the shorthand symbol for the language after the first three backticks. [Reference for shorthand symbols](https://shiki.style/languages).

````
```js
  function hello() {
    console.log("hello world");
  }
```
````

```js
function hello() {
  console.log("hello world");
}
```
