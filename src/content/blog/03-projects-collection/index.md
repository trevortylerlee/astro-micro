## Working with the `projects` collection

The `projects` collections is found in `src/content/projects`.

```
📁 /src/content/projects
└── 📁 project-1
      └── 📄 index.md
└── 📁 project-2
      └── 📄 index.mdx
```

In the above example, two project posts will be generated with the folder name representing the slug.

- `https://example.com/projects/project-1`
- `https://example.com/projects/project-2`

## Provide metadata

```astro
---
title: "Astro Micro";
description: "Astro Micro is an accessible theme for Astro.";
date: "2024-03-20";
draft: false;
---
```

All that's left to do is write the content under the metadata.

```astro

description: "Astro Micro is an accessible theme for Astro";
date: "03/22/2024";
